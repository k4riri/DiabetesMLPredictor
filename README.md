# DIADETECT - Diabetes Prediction Project

## Overview
This project leverages R to predict diabetes using health metrics. It encompasses data preprocessing, feature selection, model training (SVM, Logistic Regression), and deployment via a Shiny app.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- R and RStudio
- Required R packages: `caret`, `glmnet`, `randomForest`, `pROC`, `e1071`, `dplyr`, `ROSE`, `kernlab`, `shiny`

### Installation
1. Clone this repository to your local machine.
2. Install the required R packages by running:
   ```R
   install.packages(c("caret", "glmnet", "randomForest", "pROC", "e1071", "dplyr", "ROSE", "kernlab", "shiny"))

## Running the Application
- Open `app.R` in RStudio.
- Run the app by clicking on the 'Run App' button in RStudio.
- Interact with the web application through your web browser.

## Project Structure
- `DATASET.csv`: The dataset used for training and testing the models.
- `app.R`: Shiny application for making predictions.
